This is a sample TIL (Today I Learned) entry. TIL posts are shorter notes about things you've learned, quick tips, or discoveries.

## What makes a good TIL?

- Keep it concise and focused
- Share one specific thing you learned
- Include code examples when helpful
- Tag it appropriately for easy discovery

## Example

Here's how to share a quick code tip:

```javascript
// TIL: You can use ?? instead of || for nullish coalescing
const value = null ?? 'default'; // 'default'
const zero = 0 ?? 'default';     // 0 (not 'default'!)
```

The key difference from a blog post is brevity - get to the point quickly!
