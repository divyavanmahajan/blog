Today I learned about the TypeScript projects on GitHub for January 2026 -- [https://github.com/trending/typescript?since=monthly](https://github.com/trending/typescript?since=monthly)

## The Big Picture

Almost everything in the top 17 is about **AI coding agents, personal assistants, or tooling for them**. Open source coding agents (OpenClaw, OpenCode), agent frameworks (OpenAgentsControl, PAI), skills and plugins (OpenSkills, Compound Engineering, Claude-Mem), and MCP/Chrome DevTools sit next to a couple of standout “normal” apps: Remotion (programmatic video with React), Web-Check (OSINT for websites), NocoDB (Airtable alternative), and Handy (offline speech-to-text).

## Standout Themes

1. **Personal and coding agents** — [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) lead: one as a multi-channel personal AI you self-host, the other as an open source coding agent with build/plan modes and optional desktop app.
2. **Making agents repeatable and controllable** — [OpenAgentsControl](https://github.com/darrenhinde/OpenAgentsControl) and [Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure) focus on patterns, approval gates, context, and memory so agents behave consistently and improve over time.
3. **Skills, plugins, and memory** — [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) brings Anthropic-style skills to any agent; [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) adds plan/work/review/compound workflows; [Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) adds persistent, compressed context across sessions.
4. **MCP and browsers** — [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) gives agents Chrome automation and performance tooling; [MCP ext-apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) defines how MCP servers can serve embedded UIs in chat clients.

## Full list with summaries

For all 17 projects with **name/link**, **one-line description**, and a **3-line summary** each, see the blog post: [Jan 2026 Top TypeScript Repos on GitHub](/posts/2026/02/github-trending-typescript-february-2026/).

If you’re into AI coding agents, TypeScript runtimes, or MCP, the Jan 2026 list is a good map of where the ecosystem is heading.
