# Implementation Plan - Issue #20: Create TIL: Datasette and its common use cases

## Problem
Create a Today I Learned (TIL) post about Datasette to educate readers on its utility as a data exploration and publishing tool.

## Proposed Changes
1. Create `src/content/til/2026/02/datasette-multi-tool-for-data.md`
2. Content should cover:
    - What is Datasette (SQLite explorer/API generator).
    - Common use cases (Data journalism, rapid prototyping, searchable archives).
    - Link to `datasette-ts` by `scttcper` as a TypeScript/Cloudflare Workers variant.

## Verification Plan
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify the new content.
