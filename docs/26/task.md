## Objective
Create a Python script to detect and fix double uppercase letters at the beginning of sentences (e.g., "AA" -> "A").

## Requirements
- Support Python 3.
- Use RegEx to identify boundaries.
- Support in-place file modification.
- Handle various sentence-ending punctuation.

## Definition of Done
- Script is functional and tested.
- Script handles indentation and multiline files.
- Documentation (plan, walkthrough) is provided in `docs/26/`.
