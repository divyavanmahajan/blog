# Task
Update the Fireflies transcript saving instructions in the TIL post to reflect the new preferred method of copying outer HTML via DevTools.

## Context
The previous instructions suggested saving the entire page as "Webpage, HTML Only", which might include unnecessary elements or be less reliable than copying the specific outer HTML of the transcript.
