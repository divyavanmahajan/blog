# Walkthrough
The documentation was updated to provide a more precise way of capturing the Fireflies transcript.

1.  **File updated**: `src/content/til/2026/02/converting-fireflies-ai-transcripts.md`.
2.  **Changes**:
    - Removed the instruction to use `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` to save as "Webpage, HTML Only".
    - Added instructions to right-click, inspect an element, select the `html` element, and click "Copy outer html".
    - Advised saving the copied content into a text editor as an `.html` file.
