Create a hero image for this blog post. Take the description from the front matter. It should be clear, pastel colors and easy to view. It should blend in with the blog color style. Ask questions to clarify the request. After generating the image, ask the user to confirm or ask what to change. Finally Save the image in the public/images/ folder. Add a markdown tag before the first heading. Add image to the frontmatter. Also create a Max 150px height size of the same image and save in public/images/icon with the same name.
